Cifroteca - Yuriy Iofik

Roof Raiser - Alexey Petrovskiy


Aqua Deep Music is pleased to announce its second release, split-album of two psychedelic minds Cifroteca and Roof Raiser - talented sound producers from Ukraine.

Wild Storm - its always happens when guys come together and begin to synthesize music. Aliens space-ship on the ocean ... strange crackling ... tuk-tuktuk ... had to dive very deep, and get the bottom to find what they're looking for.

And dont forget to put your aqualung while listening!
